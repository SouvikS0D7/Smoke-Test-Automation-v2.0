_______________________________________________________
Folder Structure is important

Make a folder <any name, here we call it Smoke Test Tools>
Inside it group ALL the .exe files
Inside it <Smoke Test Tools> create a folder called : buffer_folder
Inside it <Smoke Test Tools> create a folder called : reports
Inside folder reports [Smoke Test Tools > reports] create a file called : log.txt
_______________________________________________________
After running the concerned .exe file
1. In the buffered_folder folder the screenshots are saved
2. In the log.txt the status is saved
3. In the reports folder the .word document is saved
